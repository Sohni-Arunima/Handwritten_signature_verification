# Handwritten_signature_verification
This project implements a Handwritten Signature Verification system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based Siamese architecture. The system is designed to determine whether two signature images belong to the same person or not. It leverages a Siamese network to extract deep feature embeddings from signature images and uses contrastive loss to learn the similarity metric between genuine and forged signatures. The model is trained on the CEDAR Signature Dataset and includes preprocessing steps such as resizing, grayscaling, and normalization. The notebook provides functionality for training, evaluation using ROC-AUC and accuracy, threshold tuning, and real-time verification of new signatures with visualization of results.
